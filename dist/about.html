        <p>SadaNam (aka Alex Everett) became a devoted yogi in 2007 when he started taking yoga courses at the Ohio State University. He attended 4 years of level 1, level 2, and 600 level courses covering asanas, pranayama, meditation, history, anatomy, and ayurvedic medicine. He has taught yoga and well-being workshops at festivals and conventions around Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Now, he teaches Kundalini yoga in the tradition of Yogi Bhajan with the goal of uplifting, energizing, and healing people through the realization of our true potential. Alex is also a lover of devotional music from different cultures, playing guitar, drums, gong, and singing bowls with local kirtan groups. He holds a BFA in Art and Technology from the Ohio State University where he does videography and photography as manager of Educational Technology's Media Services team.</p> 
        <p>As a 220-hour KRI-certified yoga teacher, Sada Nam strives to share the gifts and benefits that yoga has given him with the world and to clear the clouds of doubt and limitation that prevent us from realizing our true self, which is absolute bliss!</p>
